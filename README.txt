Connect your Intergas Incomfort gateway to Homey.

Support for both the 'old' and new gateway are included.

For the old version of the gateway, you need to know the IP address of your gateway. This can normally be found in your router settings.

For the new version of the gateway you need to know the IP address of your gateway, the username (usually 'admin') and the password, which is printed on the back of the gateway.

If you need support, you can use the links at the bottom of this page.
